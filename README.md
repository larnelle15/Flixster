### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics definitely helped me especially the UseEffect feature review as well as the weather report lab part one as they gave me an overall feel of what react would be like in coding in real time as well as in a project setting.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would spend more time going through react documentation as so many things i didn’t understand were there. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My favorite feature is the load more button as well as the dropdown menu and these are features I feel went really well.
